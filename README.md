# Papercups

Papercups is an open source live customer chat web app. We offer a hosted version at [app.papercups.io](https://app.papercups.io/).

You can check out how our chat widget looks and play around with customizing it on our [demo page](https://app.papercups.io/demo/). The chat widget component is also open sourced at [github.com/papercups-io/chat-widget](https://github.com/papercups-io/chat-widget).

_Watch how easy it is to get set up with our Slack integration ðŸš€ :_

## Philosophy

We wanted to make a self-hosted version of tools like Intercom and Drift for companies that have privacy and security concerns about having customer data going to third party services. Weâ€™re starting with chat right now but we want to expand into all forms of customer communication like email campaigns and push notifications.

Stay tuned! We'll be posting a more detailed roadmap soon ðŸ¤“

## Getting started

Papercups runs on Elixir/Phoenix, with a TypeScript React app for the frontend.

If you haven't installed Elixir, Phoenix, NodeJS, and PostgresQL yet, you can find some great instructions here: https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix/installation.html

**tl;dr:**

- Install Elixir: https://elixir-lang.org/install.html
- Install Hex:

```
mix local.hex
```

- To check that we are on Elixir 1.6 and Erlang 20 or later, run:

```
elixir -v
Erlang/OTP 20 [erts-9.3] [source] [64-bit] [smp:8:8] [async-threads:10] [hipe] [kernel-poll:false] [dtrace]

Elixir 1.6.3
```

- Install the Phoenix application generator:

```
mix archive.install hex phx_new 1.5.4
```

- Install NodeJS: https://nodejs.org/en/download/
- Install PostgresQL: https://wiki.postgresql.org/wiki/Detailed_installation_guides

### Cloning the repo

```
git clone git@github.com:reichert621/taro.git
cd taro
```

### To start your server

- Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
- Create and migrate your database with `mix ecto.setup`
- Start the server with `mix phx.server`

This will automatically start up the React frontend in watch mode on `localhost:3000`, with the API running on `localhost:4000`.

### To start client side

The frontend code will start up automatically when you run `mix phx.server`, but for more information see: [assets/README.md](assets/README.md)

## Running tests

Create a PostgreSQL test database named: `chat_api_test`, and run:

```
mix test
```

## Setting up email alerts

Set the environment variables in the [`.env.example`](https://github.com/papercups-io/papercups/blob/master/.env.example) file.

At the moment we only support [Mailgun](https://www.mailgun.com/) â€” other messaging channels are coming soon!

## Deploying

We currently use Heroku for deployments:

```
git push heroku master
```

## Running compiler on file change

_Note_: Make sure you are running this inside of ChatApi otherwise it'll trigger on UI changes

```
./scripts/compile_watch.sh
```
